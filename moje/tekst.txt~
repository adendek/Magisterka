1. efficiency of the from woulter and big question is why
2. efficiency of a function of pt momentum and eta
3. the same for every detector 
4. focus on TT and make the each plane in the TT
5. the 3 and 4 for both MC and RD


***********************************
1. Miriam Hess talk on bethe bloche (look through the calendar at the tracking meetings)
	look at how this effects the track fit




TODO 

1. IN chi2 distribution look at the ranges!
2. Efficiency for MC If i have a track I check PID and if it is a signal plot as a function of 
3. Take the signal for the sPLot and then do the same.
4.
